# DynamicLink

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

# This Angular directive
DynamicLinkDirective, is designed to dynamically handle different types of links within an Angular application. It checks the link provided and modifies the element's behavior accordingly. If the link starts with 'http://' or 'https://', it sets the href attribute and opens the link in a new tab. If the link starts with '/', it intercepts the click event and uses the Angular Router to navigate within the application. If the link starts with '#', it scrolls to the specified element on the page. The scrollToId method ensures smooth scrolling to the specified element, even when the user is already on the same page.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
